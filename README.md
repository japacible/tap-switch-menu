This Polymer element switches between displaying two paper-menus. The element that appears under the tapped menu item becomes focused.

1. Clone the repo and grab the bower dependencies. Run a local server.
2. In Chrome DevTools (Right click > Inspect), force touch sensor (overflow icon > More tools > sensors > Touch). Observe the cursor is now a grey circle.
3. Use the cursor to 'tap' any of the items on the menu.
